By default the plugin is installed in /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0. 
It is then required to tell gstreamer where to find it with the command:
```
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/
```
The plugin can be used in any gstreamer pipeline by adding '''freeze''', the name of the plugin.

# Pipeline examples:
With fake image pipeline:
```
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! freeze ! videoconvert ! ximagesink
```

With simple video stream:
```
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src ! freeze ! queue ! videoconvert ! queue ! xvimagesink sync=false
```

By default, the plugin listen for user inputs in the terminal. You can freeze and unfreeze the video stream by entering '''f''' in the terminal.
